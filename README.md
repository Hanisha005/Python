# Python
# Hangman game python code with User Menu
The game starts with a menu where a player can choose to either play or exit.
Print Type "play" to play the game, "exit" to quit: and ask again if the player inputs something else.
If the user chooses to play, the game starts.
The player starts the game with 8 "lives", that is our player can input the wrong letter 8 times.
If the user enters the same letter twice then the program should output You already typed this letter .
Also, you should check if the user prints an English lowercase letter or not. If not, the program should print It is not an ASCII lowercase letter . 
Also, you should check if the user printed exactly one letter. If not, the program should print You should print a single letter . Remember that zero is also not one!
